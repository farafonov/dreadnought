Notes 6/10/2014:
    * Researched Initial Key Exchange using OTR as an example
        - Found Socialist Millionaire Protocol with Diffie-Hellman key exchange
        - used otr4j as example via:  NOTE: This uses 1024-bit DSA key which is predicted to be crackable within next 10 years.
          Consider using 2048 or 4096 RSA options.
        - RSA claims that 1024 bit key are likely to be crackable between 2006 and 2010.
          And that 2048 bit will be sufficient until 2030.
          
    * Talked about using OpenID/SQRL to authenticate users to register the service.
        - More research is needed.
